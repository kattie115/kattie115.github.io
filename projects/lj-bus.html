                        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                        <p>This was a project, designed during a creative hackathon. The idea for the application came while we were trying to figure out how to get to the event hall. Not being a native, made it a tad more difficuly. While we found a few apps on the play store, they were all more or less useless or outdated. They were hard to navigate, didn't offer your current location to figure out where the closes stop was, or where and how to purchase the ticket. With that, the idea to redesign a transit app for LPP (Ljubljanski potni≈°ki promet) was born.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-md-12 col-12 mt-5">
                        <h2>The Solution - Redeign</h2>
                        <p>We browsed the play store for an already existing LPP application, to get a basic idea of what they offer. This is what it was available:</p>


                        <img src="/assets/lj-bus/old.png" width="100%" class="mx-auto d-block">
                        <p class="text-center"><small>Findings on the Play Store</small></p>
                        <hr>

                        <p>Here were the problems we found within the apps: outdated timetables, poor functionality, no hierarchy with information given, bad visiual design.</p>
                        <p>We realized that that the main thing all of them lack is a way to purchase a ticket. Ljubljana already offers a "pay with phone" option. But they don't have an official application, and everything goes through Moneta (cashless payment with phone through NFC), and their buses are equiped with code readers (bar and qr). Implementing something like that into an app should not be too much of a problem. So why there isn't one already?</p>

                        <p>I was tasked with the redesign of the app. I wanted to focus on two user flows: browsing the content > finding the up to date schedules, and purchasing and using the ticket.</p>

                        <img src="/assets/lj-bus/wireframes.png" width="100%" class="mx-auto d-block">
                        <p class="text-center"><small>Application wireframes</small></p>
                        <hr>

                        <p>I started the process by looking other Map & Navigation apps and seeing what works with them, and what I enjoy. Everyone knows and uses google maps so, that was one of my inspiration (don't fix what isn't broken). After that I looked at Uber, Citymapper and Moovit.
                        </p>

                        <p>All of them have a couple key features in common:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p>Search bar</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Map that spans out the entire page - I feel like this sould be the main feature for transportation apps. With the default of showing the user where they are, and where things are in relation to their currently location.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Detailed information on the bottom- in most cases this relates to what the user currently sees on the map
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>I wanted to stir away from the excel-type sheet with a bunch of crowded useless information, and instead focus on already known features and behaviours, and make the experience easier and more comfortable for the user.</p>

                        <p>Here is how I envisioned the updated version of the home screen:</p>


                        <img src="/assets/lj-bus/home-full.png" width="100%" class="mx-auto d-block">
                        <p class="text-center"><small>Main, partial, and fully expanded</small></p>
                        <hr>

                        <p>I took the three previous features and applied them to my own design. The map spans through the entire screen giving it the sense of a transportation application. It makes the location it's prime focus, and it feels less cramped. The content also provides the sense of familiarity of other services (google maps) users are already used to. The map displays the bus pins that mark the sourounding bus stations, and pins with the alert triange that signs the expected delays with buses and traffic.
                        </p>

                        <p>The idea was also to include the nearby buses (using the gps). but we were not sure how the LLP tracks them. So while this would be an interesting and convenient feature, we decided to skip on that.
                        </p>


                        <img src="/assets/lj-bus/delays.png" width="100%" class="mx-auto d-block">
                        <p class="text-center"><small>Detailed times of a selected station, and delay alert</small></p>
                        <hr>

                        <p>In an even of heavy trafic, an event happening, or anything which would result in delay, I used a system of alerts. If a bus is delayed a red triangle will appear in different places within the app - on a pin, next to station name in the list of upcoming busses, or in the detailed view (which also describes where and why the delay is happening, and how much longer the waiting time will be). Users can also select the option ( ! icon) to get notification on ther phone home screen for selected or favourite trips.</p>

                        <img src="/assets/lj-bus/ticket.png" width="100%" class="mx-auto d-block">
                        <p class="text-center"><small>Detailed times of a selected station, and delay alert</small></p>
                        <hr>

                        <p>The search bar expands into a menu, that allows users to display different labels on the map (choosing between emergency institutions, restaurants, unversities, bussines), settings, option to add the monthly pass - LPP and the app use the users phone number to grant acces to the pass, and a way to purchase a ticket in advance with moneta or a debit / credit card. </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-md-12 col-12 mt-5">
                        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                        <p>We took this challenges due to the real life problems we have faced. I used it as an opportunity to better myself as a UI / UX designer.</p>
                        <p>My main goal was to better understand user interaction behaviours and how to stick to a consistent design. I think I came out of this having a better understanding of how to prepare and lead a project, conduct UX research, and do usability tests.</p>
                        <p>If I had more time, I'd preform interviews, make surveys, and see what the average user is like, and what other features that we missed out might contribute to the better of the app.</p>
